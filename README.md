Historical FreeRTOS repo
========================

This repository contains all releases of FreeRTOS up to v10.0.1. I needed
something like this for archaeological purposes, but couldn't find anything
which covers the whole release history of the project.

The master branch only contains a cleaned export from the respective tarball
which only has the plain FreeRTOS sources. The `full` branch contains the whole
zip-file contents, but without the `Demo` directory, as this got really bloaty
in recent versions.

The commit timestamps correspond to the modification timestamps of the
zip-files as received from SourceForge.
